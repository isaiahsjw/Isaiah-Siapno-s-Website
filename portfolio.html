    <h1> This was our Scratch game called ITS RAINING CATS AND DOGS. Its a game where you are a character and try to avoid the cats and dogs but you also can get life increases with the unicorn and cake. If you lose all three lives then it says game over. I never got the health bar to show up properly.   </h1>
